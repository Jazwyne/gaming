            <h1>This Acclaimed Chess Roguelike Has Just Made the Jump from Steam to Mobile</h1>
            <img src="news1.webp">
            <p>The Ouroboros King is one of the most quietly successful Steam games of 2023.<p>
          <p>While it’s more than possible that you’ve never heard of it, this innovative take on chess has built a loyal following in the nine months or so since it launched, maintaining an impressive 9/10 average user rating.</p>
              <p>So we’re very happy to reveal that developer Oriol Cosp has brought The Ouroboros King to Android and iOS, allowing mobile gamers to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>Here’s the lowdown.</p>
<p>The Ouroboros King is billed as a chess roguelike game set in the Kingdom of Thessalonia—or rather, multiple Kingdoms of Thessalonia linked to different timelines, all of them plagued by an evil Coven.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, The Ouroboros King combines classic chess pieces that move in conventional fashion with novel chess pieces that do new and exciting things.</p>
<p>This can include the martyr exploding when captured – but also extends to how pieces impact others, such as the gorgon immobilising surrounding pieces and the bannerman moving like a king but allowing nearby pieces to move like queens.</p>
<p>As in chess, you can only move one piece per turn. But unlike chess The Ouroborous King gives you a host of relics to deploy—special items that grant you bonuses or temporary powers. </p>
<p>There are synergies between particular pieces, too, adding an extra tactical dimension to a game that already allows for more combinations than there are atoms in the known universe. </p>
<p>Once you fall in The Ouroboros King, you come back to life in another timeline where you’ll encounter a different procedurally generated map, different enemies, and different rewards. </p>

<p>The Coven is still your target in every timeline, and after you’ve taken it down you can do it all again at a variety of difficulty levels.</p>
<p>The Ouroboros King is totally free to download, though you’ll have to pay to unlock the full version. This adds Acts 2 and 3, 35 new units, two new location types, a Practice mode, and an Infinite mode.</p>
